VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_CAPTURE_DIRECT_DESCRIPTION = "Direct/API processing allows merchants to keep their customers on their site throughout the entire checkout process. This provides a much smoother checkout experience, and keeps the details of the underlying payment processor completely hidden from the customers. The API for this method exposes the full functionality of the payment system. This method requires the merchant’s system to be able to serve out HTTPS pages, which will likely require them to have an SSL certificate."
VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_CAPTURE_HPF = "Hosted Payment Form"
VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_CAPTURE_HPF_DESCRIPTION = "Hosted Payment Form – we can provide a secure payment form which the customer is redirected to during the checkout process. They will complete the order on our system and then be redirected back to the merchant’s system with the results of the transaction. Our system allows this payment form to be completely re-skinned so that it closely matches the merchant’s own branding. This method is generally used by merchants who are using a shopping cart that does not support the Direct/API integration method, merchants who cannot host secure (HTTPS) pages or merchants who would like to completely outsource the payment process of their website – usually for PCI compliance reasons."
VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_HASH_METHOD = "Hash Method"

VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_SHA1_DESCRIPTION = "SHA1 is the default setting in the MMS and is more secure than MD5"

VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_DELIVERY_METHOD_DESCRIPTION = "Merchant’s systems need to know the result for each completed transaction. The Server Result Methods determine how the transaction results are delivered back to the merchants system. They all have their own reasons to choose/not choose them. This is a decision that the merchant  must make."
VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_SERVER_PULL_DESCRIPTION = "When chosen, the results are PULLED FROM the payment form by the merchant's system AFTER the customer has been redirected back to the website. This has the advantage of getting around the modern security warning if you’re not using HTTPS (Secure Connection)."
VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_SERVER_DESCRIPTION = "When chosen, the results are PUSHED TO the ServerResultURL on the merchant's website BEFORE the customer is redirected back to the merchant’s site. This has the advantage of getting around the modern security warning if the merchant is not using HTTPS (Secure Connection). "
VMPAYMENT_PAYVECTOR_POST_DESCRIPTION = "Choosing the POST method will deliver the full results via the customer's browser as a form post back to the CallbackURL. The downside is, if the CallbackURL does not begin with HTTPS (notice the significance of the S), then the connection is not secure. If that is the case, most modern browsers throw a security warning to the customer explaining that sensitive information is being passed over to an insecure connection. We do not send sensitive information back, but the browsers are trying to safeguard the customer. As a result, we show the customer a dialog informing them of the reason why they are about to see a security warning and how to handle it."
